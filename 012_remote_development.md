### Remote development via SSH

#### Install Extensions

To get started, you need to:

* Install an OpenSSH compatible SSH client if one is not already present.
* Install the Remote Development extension pack.

#### Remote - SSH

With the Remote - SSH extension installed, you will see a new Status bar item at the far left.

The Remote Status bar item can quickly show you in which context VS Code is running (local or remote) and clicking on the item will bring up the Remote - SSH commands.
