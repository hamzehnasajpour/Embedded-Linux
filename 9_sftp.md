### SFTP

When remotely connecting to another computer or transferring files between computers,you must use encryption. Encryption will protect usernames, passwords, and other sensitive information. This requires the use of secure protocols:

*    Secure Shell (SSH) creates a secure connection when you log in to a remote computer.
*    Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) uses SSH and provides a secure way to transfer files between computers.
